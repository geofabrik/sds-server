# Description

This is a Ruby on Rails server application that serves as the
counterpart for JOSM's "separate data store" plugin which lives
at http://svn.openstreetmap.org/applications/editors/josm/plugins/sds/.

It can store extra tags for OSM objects and deliver them to
JOSM where they are processed like normal tags.
